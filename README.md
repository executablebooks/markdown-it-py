> Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.

- Follows the __[CommonMark spec]__ + adds syntax extensions & sugar (URL autolinking, typographer).
- Configurable syntax! You can add new rules and even replace existing ones.
- High speed.
- [Safe][security-doc] by default.
- Pluginable


This is a Python port of [markdown-it],
and some of its associated plugins.
It is still under development, so for now should be used with caution.

For details on [markdown-it] itself, see:

- The __[Live demo](https://markdown-it.github.io)__
- [The markdown-it README][markdown-it-readme]

## The Port

Details of the port can be found in `markdown_it/port.yaml` and in `port.yaml`
within the extension folders. But the driving design philosophy has been to change as little of the
fundamental code structure (file names, function name, etc) as possible, just sprinkling in a little Python syntactic sugar.
It is very simple to write complimentary extensions for both language implementations!


## Install

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge markdown-it-py
```

or

```bash
pip install markdown-it-py
```


## Basic usage

See also:

- [Using `markdown_it`][using-the-api] - for an executable notebook guide to the API
- [Development info] - for plugins writers.

```python
from markdown_it import MarkdownIt
from markdown_it.extensions.front_matter import front_matter_plugin
from markdown_it.extensions.footnote import footnote_plugin

md = (
    MarkdownIt()
    .use(front_matter_plugin)
    .use(footnote_plugin)
    .disable('image')
    .enable('table')
)
text = ("""
---
a: 1
---

a | b
- | -
1 | 2

A footnote [^1]

[^1]: some details
""")
tokens = md.parse(text)
html_text = md.render(text)
```

Also you can use it from the command-line:

```console
$ markdown-it
markdown-it-py [version 0.1.0] (interactive)
Type Ctrl-D to complete input, or Ctrl-C to exit.
>>> > **hallo** there!
...
<blockquote>
<p><strong>hallo</strong> there!</p>
</blockquote>
```

## Benchmarking

markdown-it-py is the fastest _**CommonMark compliant**_ parser written in python!

```console
$ markdown-it-bench -n 30
Test document: spec.md
Test iterations: 30
Running 7 test(s) ...
=====================
[mistune         (0.8.4): 3.62 s]*
markdown-it-py   (0.1.0): 9.03 s
mistletoe        (0.10.0): 9.89 s
commonmark-py    (0.9.1): 20.82 s
pymarkdown       (3.2.1): 34.50 s
pymarkdown:extra (3.2.1): 41.86 s
panflute         (1.12.5): 35.02 s
```

As you can see, `markdown-it-py` doesn't pay with speed for it's flexibility.

\*Note `mistune` is not CommonMark compliant, which is what allows for its
faster parsing, at the expense of issues, for example, with nested inline parsing.
See [mistletoes's explanation](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe#performance)
for further details.
