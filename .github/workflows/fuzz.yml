name: fuzzing

# This action runs fuzzing for a brief period of time,
# only aginst the actual code added in the PR.
# It is intended a relatively quick check,
# to guard against code introducing crashes in the Markdown parsing,
# which should in principle always run against any text input.
# See: https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/continuous-integration/#how-it-works
# Note, to reproduce a crash locally, copy to `testcase` file` and run: `tox -e fuzz`
